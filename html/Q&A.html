      <p> <span> 1. What type of whitening gel is included in the<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GREAT-WHITE System? </span> <br />
        We offer 2 strengths of whitening gel, 10% and 16%. These are the recommended standards across Europe. Both strengths will ultimately achieve the same level of whiteness. The strength of the gel merely influences how fast you will achieve this level of whiteness. Think of them like the tortoise and the hare – same finishing line, different finishing time. </p>
      <p> The difference in speed between the tortoise strength (that's the 10%) and the hare strength (that's the 16%) whitening gel is just a few days. We recommend that you start off with the tortoise strength whitening gel as there's less chance of experiencing tooth sensitivity, as they say slow and steady wins the race. </p>
      <p> You can always progress to the hare strength once you are comfortable with the tortoise strength whitening gel. So if in<br />
        doubt – go with the tortoise. </p>

      <p> <span>2. What about laser and heat teeth whitening – I've heard <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it's better?</span> <br />
        No! In fact it is less effective. Clinical trials show repeatedly that light and heat do not increase the intensity of teeth whitening and are not necessary for teeth whitening. Much of the initial teeth whitening from these systems is due to dehydration of the tooth surface which reverses within hours, something they don't show you on the makeover shows on telly. </p>
      <p>The most important factors in teeth whitening are the amount of time the teeth are in the contact with the whitening gel and the strength of that whitening gel. Light systems use a higher concentration of peroxide that can cause burning of the gums, and all laser and heat systems recommend that you continue treatment with a whitening tray and whitening gel is at home anyway!</p>

      <p> <span>3. What about the whitening kits I see in the supermarket – <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they are much cheaper…</span> <br />
        We are sorry to say these kits don't work very well. The whitening trays do not provide a good fit and the whitening gel is very weak. If they did work, well GREAT-WHITE wouldn't exist. </p>
      <p>We are all for affordable teeth whitening but not if it compromises on effectiveness. The last thing you want to do is go through the teeth whitening process and end up with the same coloured teeth!</p>

      <hr>
      <p> <span>4. How long will it take to whiten my teeth with <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GREAT-WHITE?</span> <br />
        Moderately stained teeth typically take around 6 - 10 applications of whitening gel to achieve your desired level of whiteness. It is best to leave 24 hours between each application so this translates to 6 - 10 days. </p>
      <p>For heavily stained teeth it may take up to a month to obtain the level of whiteness you are looking for so be patient! You will end up with whiter teeth but it won't happen overnight. For the lower strength whitening gel (10% carbamide peroxide) the application time of the whitening gel is either overnight or for 4-5 hours. </p>
      <p>The stronger whitening gel (16% carbamide peroxide) requires 2-3 hours per application up to overnight, depending on the level of sensitivity you experience.</p>

      <hr>
      <p> <span>5. Will whitening my teeth damage or weaken them?</span> <br />
        No, in spite of the whitening myths out there bleaching your enamel does not weaken or damage it in any way. </p>
      <p>Even in long-term studies where patients received extreme amounts of tooth whitening with high concentration bleach, over night, for 6 months the amount of reduction in tooth enamel was insignificant. </p>
      <p>Any sensitivity experienced during teeth whitening is due to the temporary opening of your teeth's pores. This is only temporary and does not mean your teeth have been damaged or weakened.</p>
      <p> <a href="#" class="all">Back to top</a> </p>
      <hr>
      <p> <span>6. How long will my teeth stay white for? </span> <br />
        While teeth whitening is not permanent, your teeth can stay white for a number of years. You can help the little fellas along by making sure you keep them clean and healthy as well as occasional whitening top ups: 1 - 3 applications every 4-6 months. </p>
      <p>Another tip is to avoid smoking, drinking large amounts of tea, coffee and red wine. These are the archenemies of white teeth.</p>

      <hr>
      <p> <span>7. Should I visit my dentist before or during treatment? </span> <br />
        It is best to pay your dentist a visit beforehand to make sure whitening your teeth with carbamide Peroxide is suitable for you. In most cases carbamide peroxide works fantastically well but we think that it is best to check beforehand. </p>
      <p>Have a read of our FAQ Does the GREAT-WHITE system work for everyone? (make this a link) for more information. At the end of the day we want happy customers and don't want to sell you something that's not right for you.</p>

      <hr>
      <p> <span>8. Does the GREAT-WHITE system work for everyone?</span> <br />
        No, the GREAT-WHITE System the GREAT-WHITE system is not suitable for people with:</p>
      <p>• White fillings<br />
        • Bridgework<br />
        • A fixed brace<br />
        • Crowns<br />
        • Veneers<br />
        • Loose or decayed teeth<br />
        • Gum disease<br />
        • Exposed roots<br />
        • Damaged fillings<br />
        • Or who are pregnant or breastfeeding<br />
      </p>
      <p>You see the GREAT-WHITE system only whitens teeth; it does not whiten crowns, bridgework, white fillings, veneers or any other dental treatment. So, for example, if you have a white filling that matches your tooth colour before whitening, after whitening you may get the unwelcome surprise that your filling now looks darker than your newly whitened teeth. In general we recommend that you pay your dentist a visit before whitening your teeth to make sure none of the above conditions apply to you. Take it as an excuse to conduct a dental MOT. </p>

      <p> <span>9. Will I experience any tooth or gum sensitivity when <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GREAT-WHITE? </span> <br />
        About half of all people who try teeth whitening products experience a degree of tooth or gum sensitivity. This can be minimised by using a desensitising toothpaste such as Sensodyne before you start whitening and using the lower strength (10%) whitening gel. </p>
      <p>Sensitivity typically ends with in a few days. Another way to reduce sensitivity is to decrease the amount of time you have the whitening trays in your mouth. If the sensitivity continues stop whitening your teeth and have a check up with your dentist to make sure there is not an underlying problem. </p>
      <p> <a href="#" class="all">Back to top</a> </p>
      <hr>
      <p> <span>10. Crikey, I swallowed some whitening gel? </span> <br />
        Don't panic! Drink a pint of water straight away. The worse that can happen is a slightly sore throat. If you accidentally swallow more than you would use in a single dose we recommend you to contact your GP or practice nurse.</p>

      <p> <span>13. How much tooth whitening gel should I use in my trays?</span> <br />
        Because your GREAT-WHITE whitening trays are custom fitted you only need to use a small amount of whitening gel. If you can see any whitening gel spillage when you put the trays in your mouth you are using too much. </p>
      <p>The GREAT-WHITE system includes 4 tubes of whitening gel which is enough for approximately 20 applications, 10 for the top teeth and 10 for the bottom teeth.</p>
      <p> <a href="#" class="all">Back to top</a> </p>
      <hr>
      <p> <span>14. What should I do if I run out of whitening gel?</span> <br />

      <p> <span>15. How should I store my whitening gels? </span> <br />
        For best results keep your whitening gels refrigerated. The whitening gel flows best at room temperature so you may want to remove the whitening gel from the fridge an hour or so before use.</p>
